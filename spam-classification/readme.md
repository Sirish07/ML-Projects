## Spam-classification using both ML and DL techniques (pytorch).

### Machine Learning

1. Implemented SVM, Naive Bayes, Random Tree Classifier to compare the accuracy between the models.
2. Used bag of words, truncated SVD components, Tf-idf transformer approaches for feature extraction
3. Validated the performance using StratifiedKFold

### Deep Learning

1. LSTM based spam-ham classification in pytorch
2. Customized DataLoaders for easy access
3. Glove-based pretrained embedding vectors also available for training
